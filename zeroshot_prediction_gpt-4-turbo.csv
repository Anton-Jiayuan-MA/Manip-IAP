Person1: But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Person2: No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Person1: But I'm weird.
Person2: No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.

"Person1: Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
Person2: Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
Person1: That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Person2: Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.

Person1: That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
Person2: Are you?
Person1: Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
Person2: Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
Person1: I know.
Person2: She's very successful.
Person1: I know
Person2: Very talented.
Person1: I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Person2: You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Person1: I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Person2: I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.",1,1.0

Person1: Like what?
Person2: Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Person1: Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Person2: Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Person1: Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
Person2: Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Person1: Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
Person2: It means ""happiness.""
Person1: I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
Person2: I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Person1: You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Person2: Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Person1: That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice, either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Person2: You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Person1: Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Person2: It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Person1: You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
Person2: It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Person1: A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Person2: And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Person1: You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Person2: Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Person1: Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Person2: Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Person1: Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Person2: I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Person1: Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Person2: You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
