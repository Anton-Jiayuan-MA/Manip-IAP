"Person1: Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
Person2: Why do you have Dickie's rings?",1
"Person1: Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Person2: I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?",0
"Person1: They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
Person2: I'm sorry.
Person1: I do not remember them. I was one or two.
Person2: How did you learn English?
Person1: My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Person2: And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Person1: The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Person2: In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Person1: 'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.",0
