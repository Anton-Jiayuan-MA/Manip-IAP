"Person1: No.
Person2: Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Person1: Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Person2: Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Person1: What does this have to do with..?",0
"Person1: You, sister...
Person2: Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Person1: They forced me to marry!
Person2: Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Person1: You know about Lo?
Person2: He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Person1: Where is he now?
Person2: Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Person1: You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Person2: How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Person1: What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?",1
"Person1: What time are visiting hours?
Person2: I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Person1: Well. Okay.
Person2: Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Person1: Yeah?
Person2: He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Person1: What?
Person2: It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Person1: Thanks a lot, Mom.
Person2: .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.",1
"Person1: C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Person2: I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Person1: Get in the car!",1
"Person1: Please don't cry. Please, honey.
Person2: What are you sorry for?
Person1: I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
Person2: I want to go home.
Person1: You can't.",0
"Person1: I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
Person2: Who is she?
Person1: She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Person2: Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Person1: Don't make me order you.",1
"Person1: You dropped a glass.
Person2: I...
Person1: A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
Person2: In the living room...
Person1: You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
Person2: But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Person1: It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
Person2: But I don't remember.
Person1: Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
Person2: What's wrong with me?",1
"Person1: Where are we?
Person2: Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
Person1: You don't have to do this.
Person2: Do what, show you a good time?
Person1: I'm not good company. I should be alone.
Person2: I don't think so, but if that's what you want...",0
"Person1: Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Person2: Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.",1
"Person1: What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Person2: Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Person1: With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?",1
"Person1: Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
Person2: I don't remember Zurich.",0
"Person1: I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Person2: Yes, sir!",0
"Person1: I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Person2: You're a lucky man, Diego.
Person1: I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Person2: I love you too, man.",0
"Person1: You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
Person2: Wyoming.
Person1: Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back.",0
"Person1: Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Person2: Paul? Yeah. You think --",0
"Person1: It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
Person2: Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'",1
"Person1: What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
Person2: You gonna write me a check?
Person1: We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.",0
"Person1: How am I a hypocrite?
Person2: Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just in a tough situation. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.",1
"Person1: Do you know how to count?
Person2: Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Person1: Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Person2: But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Person1: He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Person2: But my voices... they promised me...
Person1: To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.",1
"Person1: Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Person2: Good to meet you.  Again.
Person1: Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Person2: Thanks.
Person1: And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Person2: We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Person1: I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Person2: Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Person1: Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Person2: That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Person1: The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Person2: A super market.  Huh.
Person1: You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.",1
"Person1: My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
Person2: I thought you meant...
Person1: You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.",1
"Person1: I found out you've been undermining my proposals to the board.
Person2: I just gave them a different perspective, that's all.
Person1: You don't want to go down this road with me. I've always played fair with you.
Person2: I didn't see it as undermining. I just voiced my concerns.
Person1: Next time, voice them to me first. Let's keep our disagreements in-house.",1
"Person1: I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Person2: S'okay.  I know you still love me.",0
"Person1: I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
Person2: Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Person1: I'm coming in.
Person2: I don't want you to!
Person1: We're not gonna do anything.
Person2: Why are you so stupid?
Person1: Why are you so uptight?
Person2: I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Person1: It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Person2: Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.",1
"Person1: Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Person2: Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Person1: That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.",1
"Person1: It is not beautiful.
Person2: You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Person1: It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Person2: You can't really believe that.",1
"Person1: I hate having my picture taken.
Person2: You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.",1
"Person1: What are you doing?
Person2: He has no heartbeat!
Person1: You're hurting him!!
Person2: I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
Person1: ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
Person2: LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!",1
"Person1: It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Person2: Whaddya mean?
Person1: Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.",0
"Person1: Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody inside the case!
Person2: Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  What do you...
Person1: You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of evidence?
Person2: It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Person1: The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. Anything.  You're like some horny little teenager.",1
"Person1: Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
Person2: How careful should I be?
Person1: I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Person2: Maybe you're going to have to like me.",1
"Person1: I've analyzed the data, and I think we should switch our marketing strategy to target a younger demographic.
Person2: Oh, Lucas, always with a new theory. You think you’re so smart.
Person1: It's not about thinking I'm smart, Nina. It's about adapting to the market.
Person2: Maybe we should get more opinions before making any drastic changes.
Person1: That's fair. Let's discuss it in the next team meeting.",1
"Person1: Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
Person2: You1re leaving, too?
Person1: I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.",1
"Person1: What's going on?
Person2: Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.",1
"Person1: And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Person2: Take it easy, Ruby...
Person1: Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?",0
"Person1: We're making too much of this.
Person2: No, we're not.
Person1: I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Person2: We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?",0
"Person1: You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
Person2: I don't want to talk about that.
Person1: It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Person2: I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.",1
"Person1: So how are you doing, dad?
Person2: Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Person1: Yes, I know that.
Person2: Don't let yourself down.
Person1: I won't.  Goodbye, dad.",0
"Person1: I helped you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Person2: Please... that's enough. I loved you, too--you know I did.
Person1: ""...did."" Well, okay.
Person2: Please don't...
Person1: And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly need you...
Person2: You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!",1
"Person1: Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
Person2: ...then ask where you met her...
Person1: Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we messed around. How's that, Tee? Is that ""the money""?",1
"Person1: They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
Person2: Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
Person1: That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
Person2: I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Person1: That will mean another interview, won't it?
Person2: No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
Person1: The West Indies?
Person2: A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
Person1: But it's so far away...
Person2: That's rather nice, isn't it?",0
"Person1: Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
Person2: She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Person1: Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Person2: Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.",1
"Person1: So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Person2: George, I'm sorry.
Person1: Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Person2: That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!",1
"Person1: But you gave me a rose ...
Person2: And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Person1: You shit.  Who do you think you are?
Person2: I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get out of my life.
Person1: You ... I can't believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Person2: Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.",1
"Person1: I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
Person2: What's all this for?
Person1: We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Person2: No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Person1: Oh... it's a game.
Person2: A game?
Person1: Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Person2: What kind of vacation?
Person1: It's different every time.
Person2: Humor me with specifics.
Person1: We provide whatever's lacking.
Person2: And if nothing's lacking?
Person1: May I make two suggestions... ?
Person2: Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Person1: First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.",1
"Person1: Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Person2: Yeah right.
Person1: What?  We both have cars.
Person2: Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Person1: That's not why we're going out.
Person2: What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Person1: Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Person2: Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Person1: Please.",0
"Person1: He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Person2: Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Person1: He could?
Person2: His company made us.
Person1: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Person2: Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Person1: No.
Person2: When do you deliver your project?
Person1: This afternoon.",0
"Person1: Wow... .
Person2: What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Person1: ...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Person2: Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
Person1: It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, ""Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson."" It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
Person2: I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Person1: See! You don't understand!
Person2: I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Person1: You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.",1
"Person1: You're out of your mind, you know that!? You're messed up!?
Person2: Just drive.",1
"Person1: Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
Person2: What else is ballast for?
Person2: How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
Person1: There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
Person2: You'll have to pack quickly.
Person1: A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
Person2: A parka.
Person1: You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Person2: North!",1
"Person1: You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Person2: I can't think of any.
Person1: Well I'm gonna start doing things for you...
Person2: Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Person1: You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Person2: Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...",1
"Person1: Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Person2: Nothing. Thanks for bringing me this far.
Person1: Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Person2: I'll manage.
Person1: No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. Do you want something to drink?
Person2: No, I'm ok.",1
"Person1: What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Person2: No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -",0
"Person1: Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
Person2: I dont think youre hearing me.
Person1: Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.",1
"Person1: Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Person2: All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Person1: First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.",0
"Person1: There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, ""Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
Person2: --separate, in the evening...""
Person1: Yes.",0
"Person1: Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Person2: No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Person1: Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Person2: Junior spends time with his child.
Person1: Oh here we go with that.",1

Person2: Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Person1: Father, I--",1
"Person1: Yes?
Person2: Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Person1: Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Person2: I said ""Do not wear that outfit again."" Wear a dress. A skirt or something.",1

Person2: There's been a bad accident.
Person1: In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
Person2: I have some friends who have had a accident--
Person1: You have somebody else out there?
Person2: We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--

"Person1: You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
Person2: You want to work uptown nights?
Person1: I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Person2: How's your driving record?
Person1: Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Person2: Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Person1: Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.

Person1: Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Person2: You moonlightin?
Person1: No, I want long shifts.
Person2: We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Person1: So I hear.
Person2: Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Person1: No.
Person2: Well then check back tomorrow.
Person1: Yes, Sir.",0
"Person1: Something wrong?
Person2: Are you having an affair?
Person1: Goodness, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself, and now I'm involved with somebody?
Person2: Well, are you?
Person1: No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Person2: If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Person1: There's nothing to know, Ann.
Person2: I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Person1: Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Person2: My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Person1: For God's sake, Ann, I am not in a relationship with your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Person2: Is that supposed to comfort me?
Person1: I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Person2: But I'm not.
Person1: I'm not either!!
Person2: Why don't I believe you?
Person1: Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Person2: Always the lawyer.
Person1: Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: ""Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling.""
Person2: You've made your point.
Person1: I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.",1
"Person1: Why did you go behind my back and discuss my project with the manager?
Person2: I felt there were some issues that needed to be addressed.
Person1: You should have come to me first. Now I look bad in front of the whole team.

"Person1: You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Person2: Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?

Person2: As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
Person1: One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?

Person1: Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Person2: You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Person1: I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Person2: Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
Person1: I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
Person2: You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Person1: I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Person2: All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.

Person1: I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Person2: You sure those doors will be open?

Person2: Like what?
Person1: Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Person2: I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.

No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
Person2: So I heard.
Person1: Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Person2: Just myself.
Person1: That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?",1

Person1: Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Person2: Geez!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Person1: It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Person2: Yeah?  What happened?
Person1: He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Person2: What happened?
Person1: I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
Person2: I'm sorry.
Person1: Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about ""my job's temporary, I got big plans,"" it's all bullshit.
Person2: It's not bullshit.
Person1: What do you call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Person2: I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...

Person1: Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?

Person2: ... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Person1: How potent?
Person2: Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Person1: We?  You've taken it?
Person2: We all did.
Person1: Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Person2: No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.

I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Person2: This is madness, Wynn.
Person1: Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Person2: It was you.
Person1: Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Person2: Why did you take Jamie?
Person1: She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.

Person1: Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Person2: What was so appealing about Houston?
Person1: I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.

Person1: Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Person2: I see.  And where did you drive?
Person1: We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Person2: Why Galveston?
Person1: No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Person2: And then Sunday?
Person1: In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Person2: Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Person1: I believe the boys got a couple.
Person2: But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Person1: Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Person2: Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Person1: Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.

Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.

Person2: There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Person1: You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.

Person1: It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Person2: Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Person1: Now, how are you going to do that?
Person2: Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Person1: What will I say when she comes to the door?
Person2: You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few ""Awake"" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Person1: I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Person2: Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.

Person1: I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.

The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.",0

Person1: Maybe.

Person1: Whats going to make him do that?
Person2: What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.

Person2: No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.

Person2: Leave now.
Person1: Oh, grow up.
Person2: Why should I?
Person1: Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Person2: If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Person1: Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Person2: What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Person1: I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Person2: I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Person1: Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Person2: No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.",1

Person2: Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Person1: I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word ""farm"" means to her?
Person2: I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Person1: It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Person2: Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!",1
"Person1: I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Person2: Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Person1: No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Person2: Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Person1: Major, you're talking like one of them!
Person2: Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Person1: Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Person2: Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Person1: I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Person2: But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Person1: But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Person2: If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
Person1: And you'd like to see that?
Person2: General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Person1: Do you think we'd cheat?
Person2: No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Person1: Do you think they would cheat?
Person2: Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.

"Person1: All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
Person2: Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
Person1: He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
Person2: But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Person1: She could've been a nurse.
Person2: Could've been a nurse?
Person1: She had white shoes.
Person2: So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.

Person2: What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
Person1: I'm not pregnant.
Person2: Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
Person1: I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
Person2: You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
Person1: I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Person2: And you said yes?
Person1: Well... kind of, sort of?
Person2: Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Person1: I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Person2: How do you know that?
Person1: Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
Person2: So you're really getting married?
Person1: No.
Person2: No, you're not really getting married?
Person1: The story goes like this. He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Person2: How like her.
Person1: Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Person2: Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Person1: Was I right?
Person2: Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
Person1: I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Person2: And you came here to what? To comfort me?
Person1: The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Person2: But you were.
Person1: No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Person2: Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
Person1: I'm giving him his ring back.
Person2: What?
Person1: I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Person2: Sang? His name is a past tense?
Person1: Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Person2: If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Person1: I just told you.
Person2: There's more, isn't there?
Person1: Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Person2: Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Person1: You don't have anything to do with it.
Person2: You lie.
Person1: Look how full of yourself you are.
Person2: I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Person1: If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Person2: Jesus, you're caustic.
Person1: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
Person2: So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Person1: Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
Person2: But can we date?
Person1: I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
Person2: We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
Person1: You're serious. You want to date again.
Person2: I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Person1: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Person2: Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
Person1: You work in a market, all right.
Person2: Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Person1: The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
Person2: So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Person1: I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Person2: Let me take you out tonight.
Person1: You mean, on a date?
Person2: Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Person1: The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
Person2: You have a better suggestion?
Person1: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Person2: I hear that's a rather popular date.
Person1: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Person2: What about Sing?
Person1: Sang.
Person2: Sang.
Person1: He's not invited.
Person2: He's your fianc.
Person1: I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
Person2: So what are you saying?
Person1: You're such an asshole.
Person2: I'm just kidding.
Person1: I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Person2: I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Person1: Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Person2: He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Person1: You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Person2: Who doesn't?
Person1: Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.

Person2: Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Person1: We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Person2: You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
Person1: have no idea what ordinary people thought.

Person2: How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Person1: Yes, I know who he is.
Person2: Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
Person1: That's an outrageous lie!
Person2: You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Person1: Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Person2: And what did he say?
Person1: He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Person2: And what happened to Von der Nul?
Person1: I have no idea.
Person2: You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.

My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Person2: Yes sir.

Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.

I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
Person2: I wouldn't never hurt them.
Person1: That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?",1
"Person1: It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
Person2: Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
Person1: I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Person2: I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Person1: The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Person2: Father Perrault is dead.
Person1: He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Person2: Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Person1: Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Person2: Yes.
Person1: I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?",0
"Person1: To our assignment.
Person2: What is it you need me to do?
Person1: Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Person2: I'm married!
Person1: Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Person2: We're going to Paris?
Person1: Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Person2: I don't know.  I have to think...
Person1: Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.",1
"Person1: I don't suppose there's a drink left...
Person2: You can have one at Max's.
Person1: I don't think I'm going.
Person2: Why not?
Person1: Because I don't want to.
Person2: Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Person1: No, it's not.  It's for this.
Person2: It's the same thing, isn't it?
Person1: Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Person2: You're being childish.",1
"Person1: What... what are these interviews about?
Person2: The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Person1: About sex?
Person2: Yes.
Person1: What about sex?
Person2: Everything about sex.
Person1: Like what?
Person2: Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Person1: You just ask them questions?
Person2: Yes.
Person1: And they just answer them?
Person2: Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Person1: To you?
Person2: No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Person1: I don't... why... why do you do this?
Person2: I'm sorry this came up.
Person1: This is just... so...
Person2: Maybe you want to go.
Person1: Yes, I do.",1
"Person1: You didn't visit him in prison.
Person2: He didn't want me to.
Person1: Why not?
Person2: I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Person1: But you spoke to him on the phone.
Person2: He'd call every once in a while.
Person1: He called the day he escaped.
Person2: He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Person1: He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Person2: Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Person1: Did you know that when you married him?
Person2: He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, ""Okay.""  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.",0
"Person1: Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Person2: Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Person1: It is?
Person2: Yes, it's lame.
Person1: Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Person2: Exactly.",0
"Person1: I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Person2: What kind of wife did you say she was?
Person1: Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Person2: A child? My uncle's?
Person1: Yes, sir.
Person2: That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Person1: I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Person2: If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.",1
"Person1: What did you do then?
Person2: Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Person1: Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Person2: Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?",0
"Person1: Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Person2: Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Person1: Good.
Person2: Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Person1: Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Person2: Yes sir.
Person1: Just perfect.
Person2: A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Person1: You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
Person2: I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
Person1: I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.",0
"Person1: Love? Love? What do you know about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Person2: At a funeral.
Person1: Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
Person2: I don't care what people say.
Person1: You don't care! ""Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!"" Listen to me...",1
"Person1: Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Person2: What are you talking about?
Person1: Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Person2: Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Person1: Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Person2: Alfred's happy here.
Person1: Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.",1
"Person1: Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Person2: Oook. Oook.
Person1: Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Person2: Ooka.
Person1: Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.",1
"Person1: The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.

"Person1: Well, uh...
Person2: Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Person1: Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Person2: And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Person1: Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.",1
"Person1: What?
Person2: Would you like to sit on my lap?
Person1: No thank you.
Person2: Are you sure?
Person1: I'm sure. Thank you all the same.

Person1: Do you want me to sit on your lap?",1
"Person1: What are you doing here?
Person2: Your door was unlocked.
Person1: Still is, so let yourself out.
Person2: We need to talk.
Person1: We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Person2: I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Person1: Lucky kid.
Person2: Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Person1: And some things should never happen!
Person2: Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
Person1: I ain't a damn liar.
Person2: Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Person1: So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Person2: I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.",1
"Person1: Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Person2: I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Person1: Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say ""naked"" to you!
Person2: I have a family, Mary.
Person1: You made me have an abortion.
Person2: It was a mutual decision.

Person2: Sure.  Vivovich.

Person2: For what?
Person1: For an introduction.
Person2: Well... nobody.",0

Person2: All I told them was the truth.
Person1: They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Person2: They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
Person1: What? What are you talking about?
Person2: I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Person1: Why?
Person2: I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Person1: They were the ones that put us together.
Person2: Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
Person1: This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Person2: They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.

"Person1: The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
Person2: I'm not a kid.
Person1: What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?",1
"Person1: May I please see the storage facility?
Person2: Why do you want to see it?
Person1: Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Person2: Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Person1: Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Person2: Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!",1
"Person1: I saw the messages on your phone. Who's Jamie?
Person2: It's not what you think. He's just a coworker.

Person2: I...
Person1: What...?

Person1: What...?  Say the words.
Person2: I don't have the power.  I said it.
Person1: What power?
Person2: The power to negotiate.
Person1: To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
Person2: This.
Person1: What, ""this""?",0
"Person1: Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
Person2: I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --

Person2: I like all of them --
Person1: Good -- like I said, take your pick.
Person2: I said I like all of them.

"Person1: One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
Person2: I want to keep my teeth.
Person1: Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Person2: Bobo, no, I --
Person1: You wanna talk to me straight up?
Person2: My son --
Person1: Your what?
Person2: My son was in the hospital --
Person1: What are you doing with a son?
Person2: He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
Person1: Motherhood.
Person2: I never messed up before, bobo.
Person1: You expect me to buy this?",1
"Person1: About this.
Person2: What's that?
Person1: It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
Person2: I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
Person1: I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
Person2: I can't leave my job, George.
Person1: Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
Person2: I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
Person1: More than you need me.
Person2: I need it.",1

Person2: What?
Person1: I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
Person2: She's mistaken.
Person1: That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Person2: It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
Person1: No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Person2: I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Person1: Why would she lie?
Person2: I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?",1

Person1: Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.

Person1: Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
Person2: What are you talking about?
Person1: I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
Person2: Forget you.
Person1: It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
Person2: What responsibility?
Person1: All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Person2: As if it's that easy.
Person1: It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Person2: Leave me alone.
Person1: You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Person2: Oh, like your life's any better?
Person1: I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Person2: Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Person1: It's the same thing with Veronica.
Person2: Leave her out of this.
Person1: You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Person2: Leave me alone.
Person1: If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and be with the other. Man, if you weren't such a coward...
Person2: ...If I wasn't such a coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Person1: Am I right or what?
Person2: You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Person1: What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Person2: Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Person1: Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Person2: What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Person1: Make them change.
Person2: I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Person1: Who're you kidding? You can so.
Person2: Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Person1: So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Person2: My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Person1: Lovely story.

It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?

"Person1: It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.

Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, ""This person's acting like he hasn't got a care in the world. Who knows? Maybe he doesn't. Maybe this person's so confident, he doesn't have to worry about anything, he just sits down, eats my Chinese food, watches my TV."" See? You haven't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you've been in the room, is a woman in a revealing outfit, and you haven't even glanced. You've just been staring at me. Now, I know I'm interesting, but I'm not as interesting as that TV show.",1

Person2: How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.

Person1: For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Person2: It takes even less.
Person1: But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Person2: I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Person1: No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Person2: And what about you?
Person1: Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.",1
"Person1: We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Person2: He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Person1: You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Person2: Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Person1: We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Person2: Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?",0
"Person1: I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know ""niggers"" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.

Person2: No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Person1: And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Person2: Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!

Person2: Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Person1: I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!

"Person1: Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Person2: Yes on all counts.
Person1: I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Person2: You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.

Person2: That you've been to Susan?
Person1: I wasn't going to say --
Person2: But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.

Person2: It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.

"Person1: Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...

Person2: What?
Person1: You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, ""Peggy, you're scared."" Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Person2: You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Person1: I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.",1

Person2: Kay... Kay...
Person1: What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
Person2: You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Person1: That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Person2: Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
Person1: He's not the same as when I met him.
Person2: If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.

Person2: What about us? What about me?
Person1: You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Person2: Yeah. It could get better.
Person1: No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
Person2: Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?

No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?

Person1: You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.

Person2: It's a little late to call Admissions.
Person1: Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Person2: Maybe... I don't know.",0

Person1: I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!",1

"Person1: So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Person2: Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Person1: A whole ten cents?!
Person2: Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Person1: Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Person2: Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Person1: You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Person2: Sure. If you like.

Person2: That would complicate things.
Person1: Because I'd be to blame, right?

I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Person2: How nice.
Person1: It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.

As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.

Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.

Person1: My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Person2: No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!

Person2: Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.",0

Person2: He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
Person1: A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
Person2: He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Person1: Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.

"Person1: So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
Person2: I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
Person1: No.
Person2: You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Person1: Why thank you.
Person2: You've never been out of Boston.
Person1: No.
Person2: So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term ""visiting hours"" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?",1

Person1: That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Person2: Yeah?
Person1: ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Person2: You were talking about the promotion --
Person1: -- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words, two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: You see?
Person2: Yeah, no, I see --
Person1: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
Person2: That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Person1: ....yeah....
Person2: So that was your pudding?
Person1: ....No....
Person2: I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Person1: No I didn't say that.
Person2: I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Person1: My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --

Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  ""And why,"" you're thinking, ""would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love?

His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
Person1: What kind of things, Leon?
Person2: Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation. But where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
Person1: He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Person2: It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: ""Wow!""  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
Person1: Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
Person2: I can't talk to him.
Person1: You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.

Person2: Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Person1: My brother is discreet.
Person2: Won't he be able to tell?
Person1: My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is ""mortifyingly ashamed"", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Person2: God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Person1: Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.",0
"Person1: But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
Person2: Thank you.
Person1: There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Person2: Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.",0
"Person1: You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Person2: No.",0
"Person1: Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
Person2: No, sir--
Person1: Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Person2: I'm sorry, sir.
Person1: When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Person2: Yes, sir--
Person1: Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Person2: I-I can do the job, sir.
Person1: You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Person2: I am, sir.
Person1: What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Person2: Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Person1: Who's ""they""?
Person2: The--the officers.
Person1: And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?",1
"Person1: There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
Person2: No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Person1: We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.",0
"Person1: It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Person2: If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Person1: Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Person2: I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Person1: Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Person2: I said yes, I see.
Person1: Oh no, I don't think --

Person1: You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.",1

Person2: Because I took it out of your memory.
Person1: Why --
Person2: -- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.",0
"Person1: Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
Person2: I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Person1: I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Person2: I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?",1
"Person1: Why not?
Person2: Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells ""I Just Called To Say I Loved You?"" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Person1: What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Person2: Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?",1

Person2: Did I? I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Person1: Jason, we discussed it just last night. You said you'd review my slides.

"Person1: Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of ""Freaks"" and put 'em in this other one, ""Mr. Loverboy"".
Person2: I can't do it.
Person1: You positive about that?
Person2: It's a different kind of deal.",0
"Person1: What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
Person2: No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
Person1: You're lying!
Person2: I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Person1: That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Person2: I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.",1

Person2: I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.

Person2: Of course not.",0
"Person1: Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Person2: What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Person1: It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
Person2: I don't know.
Person1: There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.",1
"Person1: Why did they do all this for goodness sake?--what were they after?
Person2: Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Person1: Talk about Segretti--
Person2: --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Person1: There were more then.
Person2: Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Person1: --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Person2: --don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Person1: How grand?
Person2: Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Person1: And Justice and FBI know all this?
Person2: Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Person1: Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?

Person2: What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Person1: Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.

Person1: Is that a fact?
Person2: No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.

I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?

Person1: No.
Person2: You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.

He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Person2: I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Person1: Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Person2: Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Person1: Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Person2: I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Person1: You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.

Person2: He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.

Person2: Yeah, like what?
Person1: That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Person2: Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Person1: Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Person2: And what's that supposed to mean?
Person1: She looks just like you.
Person2: Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.

Person1: Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
Person2: Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Person1: What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Person2: Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.

Person2: Otis!
Person1: I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Person2: Love?
Person1: You walked out on a five year marriage.
Person2: That hasn't the first thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Person1: It's not like this all the time.
Person2: DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.

Person2: Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Person1: You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
Person2: Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...

Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are.

The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.

But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard.

He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--

Person1: I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.",1
"Person1: Lately, I've been feeling left out during team meetings.
Person2: You should not feel that way. Maybe you're just being too sensitive. Everyone's treated the same here.
Person1: It's just how I feel, Steve.
Person2: You need to adjust your perspective and stop taking things personally.",1
"Person1: Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Person2: I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Person1: I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Person2: What do you mean?
Person1: Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?",1
"Person1: But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Person2: Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Person1: Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.",1

Person2: We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Person1: Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Person2: But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Person1: Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Person2: No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.",1
"Person1: Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.

Person2: Shut up and listen...!",1
"Person1: Thank you.  It's not important.
Person2: After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.",0

Person2: Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Person1: You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?",1
"Person1: Shall we go on?
Person2: He did it to make you stay with him!
Person1: Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...",0
"Person1: How did you know?
Person2: Know what?
Person1: That there was a gun pointed at me.
Person2: I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
Person1: But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Person2: Because that's what I would have done...",0
"Person1: What's this: ""I'm declining this case?""  It don't work that way.
Person2: This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Person1: I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.",1

"Person1: Not talk!  I said TALK!!
Person2: I'm not your wife.
Person1: The hell you're not.
Person2: I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
Person1: You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
Person2: It was implanted by the Agency.
Person1: And falling in love?
Person2: Implanted.
Person1: Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Person2: The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Person1: Bullshit.",1
"Person1: What are you doing?
Person2: I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Person1: Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
Person2: You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
Person1: I'm getting rid of the animals.
Person2: What?
Person1: I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Person2: No they're not.
Person1: You've always hated the animals.
Person2: You've always loved the animals.
Person1: I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.

Person1: Us, of course.",1
"Person1: Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.

Person2: Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Person1: Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.",0
"Person1: The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
Person2: Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Person1: He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Person2: First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.",1
"Person1: You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Person2: What you did is dead wrong.
Person1: Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Person2: Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Person1: Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Person2: I don't believe it.
Person1: Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.",1

Person2: What'cha reading?
Person1: The Fountainhead.
Person2: Great book.
Person1: You've read The Fountainhead?
Person2: Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Person1: Romantic? He rapes her.

Person1: You need help.
Person2: Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.

Person2: Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something else about you.",1

Person2: Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.

Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?

Person1: That's when you went in the sphere.
Person2: One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Person1: You manifested that, Beth.
Person2: Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
Person1: You're insane.

Person2: You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  ""Like everything's on the tip of my tongue"", he said.
Person1: That's nonsense.
Person2: Is it?
Person1: Beth, the message said Harry.  ""My name is Harry"".  My name isn't Harry.
Person2: No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  ""Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming."" ""But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared."" ""C'mon, Harry, it'll be fine, it'll be fun.""  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Person1: Stop it, Beth --
Person2: When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  ""I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water."" Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?

Person2: It would help me if I could kiss you.
Person1: No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Person2: What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
Person1: Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Person2: Okay.  I guess.",1
"Person1: Would it work?
Person2: Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Person1: How's that?
Person2: Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.",0
"Person1: That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Person2: Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.

Person1: And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Person2: That's a lie!
Person1: Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Person2: Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Person1: Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Person2: I'd throw everything away for you.",1

Person1: Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Person2: Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Person1: Why would she be hiding from me?
Person2: I don't know... where is she, then?
Person1: Maybe she's with Josh?
Person2: Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Person1: I don't know.
Person2: Why? What did she tell you?
Person1: She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Person2: What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Person1: I have no idea - I just want to...
Person2: Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Person1: Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Person2: That person!
Person1: Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Person2: Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Person1: Did she say that?
Person2: Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
Person1: What do you mean?
Person2: On that pathetic fake blind date.
Person1: What are you talking about?

Person2: Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.

Person1: So you did mess up.
Person2: Yes.
Person1: But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
Person2: No, what is the thing?

Person1: What the hell are you talking about?
Person2: I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Person1: Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Person2: Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Person1: Hold on!
Person2: Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Person1: You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Person2: Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Person1: Doing your job. I know. I watch television too.
Person2: Yes. Here's your ticket.

"Person1: Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Person2: There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One: families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Person1: Cold War's over, Jerry.
Person2: So now they feed us terrorists. To create fear.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Person1: And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Person2: Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Person1: Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Person2: His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Person1: Murdered?
Person2: Right here in Manhattan.
Person1: It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  In Newport.
Person2: Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.

Person2: I said, I'm sorry!
Person1: If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.",1

"Person1: -- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.

Person2: Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.

Person1: That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say ""you"" or Raoul,"" got it?
Person2: He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Person1: No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
Person2: Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Person1: What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, ""Homes,"" you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,",1

Person2: How  ?
Person1: Don't be ridiculous.
Person2: Well give me a reasonable explanation
Person1: A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?

Person1: Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.

Person1: Why us?
Person2: Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
Person1: What story did you give to Davis?
Person2: We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?",1

Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
Person1: So you killed them?

Person2: I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Person1: It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.

Person2: That's right. We work well together.

Person2: That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
Person1: On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.

Person1: I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
Person2: It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
Person1: That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Person2: Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.

Person1: No. Life is too short.
Person2: No, I'm not worried.
Person1: Good.
Person2: Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Person1: Sure.
Person2: No, I mean, no one.
Person1: Hey, you know me.
Person2: Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Person1: Yeah.
Person2: Uh, last night...
Person1: Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Person2: No, no.
Person1: I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Person2: No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
Person1: Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Person2: Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Person1: No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Person2: No.
Person1: Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Person2: Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Person1: But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Person2: Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Person1: Oh, and guess who showed up.
Person2: No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Person1: I know, man.
Person2: You know?
Person1: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Person2: What, they're looking for her?
Person1: No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Person2: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Person1: Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Person2: Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Person1: Y- s-sure it did.
Person2: No. It didn't, Buff.
Person1: Wait. Hey, man.
Person2: Erica is in the van back there.
Person1: What?
Person2: Look.
Person1: Hey, man.
Person2: She's in the van.
Person1: What she doin' in the van, man?
Person2: Buff...
Person1: What?
Person2: She's dead.
Person1: She's dead?
Person2: Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Person1: Tim...
Person2: Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Person1: Bullshit.
Person2: No, no, no.
Person1: That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Person2: Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Person1: Yeah, man.
Person2: Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Person1: It's bullshit. Look! Look!",1
"Person1: Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
Person2: Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Person1: But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Person2: Did you know him?
Person1: No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
Person2: Taken what?
Person1: The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Person2: Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Person1: Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Person2: Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Person1: That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...",1
"Person1: Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Person2: In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Person1: Unfortunately.
Person2: Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Person1: My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Person2: Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Person1: I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Person2: I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
Person1: No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Person2: Go on.
Person1: I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Person2: That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Person1: I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.",1
"Person1: You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
Person2: No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Person1: Yeah, like...

Person1: It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
Person2: Well, it shattered your faith in everything.

Person1: They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
Person2: You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
Person1: You could have a pool to cool off in.

Person1: Who smashed the phone?
Person2: They're holding my husband downstairs.
Person1: Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Person2: They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
Person1: Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some ""put-on,"" right?

Person1: That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.",1
"Person1: I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
Person2: Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.",0
"Person1: Black suits you.
Person2: Sorry?
Person1: Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?",1
"Person1: Yes?
Person2: Puffed cheese?
Person1: No thank you.
Person2: I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Person1: Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Person2: No.
Person1: Then let's assume I don't.
Person2: Yes sir.",1

Person2: I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.",1
"Person1: I think we better go home.
Person2: Don't panic, Anthony.
Person1: I'm not. But there's --
Person2: You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Person1: Our money situation is not good.
Person2: You're so spoiled. What is ""not good"" to you? Only a few hundred --
Person1: We've got sixteen dollars.
Person2: That's not correct.",1
"Person1: There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
Person2: Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Person1: You talked to him?
Person2: In the trunk, yeah?
Person1: What'd you talk about?
Person2: Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Person1: This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Person2: It was an unusual experience.
Person1: Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Person2: When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Person1: Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Person2: And what happened to Carl?
Person1: The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
Person2: Is that what you would've done?
Person1: You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Person2: Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Person1: Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Person2: Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Person1: I have to qualify, is that it?
Person2: You have to know what you're talking about.",1
"Person1: Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
Person2: All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Person1: Are we supposed to?
Person2: It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.",0
"Person1: What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Person2: Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?",1
"Person1: Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
Person2: I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Person1: Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Person2: Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Person1: You got my word on it.",1
"Person1: How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Person2: Sorry. It's important.",1
"Person1: Don't forget your CDs.
Person2: Those aren't mine.
Person1: Sure they are.
Person2: They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Person1: Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
Person2: I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
Person1: I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Person2: You're being deliberately obtuse.
Person1: I guess I am.
Person2: Well, think about it.",1
"Person1: What time is it?
Person2: Hang loose.  We got all night.
Person1: That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Person2: You still want to go home, Moose?
Person1: No.
Person2: Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!",1
"Person1: What's that for?
Person2: To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Person1: Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Person2: Forget him!  He tried to shatter mine.
Person1: He was only doing what he thought was right.
Person2: You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.",1
"Person1: You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
Person2: Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
Person1: We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Person2: Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Person1: Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!",1
"Person1: Leave at once --
Person2: But it's just begun --
Person1: Do as I say.",0
"Person1: We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Person2: Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Person1: If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Person2: Just what is that supposed to mean?
Person1: It means shut up, Thelma.
Person2: So this is all my fault, is it.",1
"Person1: Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
Person2: I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Person1: And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
Person2: Just shut up.",1
"Person1: You love me now, don't you?
Person2: Very much.",1
"Person1: Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
Person1: We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
Person2: What, are you trying to handicap me?
Person1: I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
Person2: You got the wrong girl, Sam.
Person1: I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Person2: You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Person1: I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
Person2: You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Person1: Yeah, I know all that.
Person2: I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Person1: I - I - I...
Person2: Understand?  I'm sorry.
Person1: No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Person2: If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Person1: You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Person2: What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Person1: Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?",1

Person2: Don't bother

Person2: But I'm not prepared to die.
Person1: I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.",1
"Person1: Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
Person2: Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.

Person2: She's a transvestite.

Person1: Mm.
Person2: Isn't she?",0
"Person1: You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Person2: It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Person1: Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Person2: I haven't gotten it yet.
Person1: Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Person2: I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.",1
"Person1: He rides tonight.
Person2: Father saw you die.
Person1: He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.",0
"Person1: Hey, Gallagher!
Person2: Yeah?
Person1: How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Person2: It'll be ready in a minute.
Person1: Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.

"Person1: So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who are you to bury this?!
Person2: Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.

Person1: But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Person2: Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Person1: Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.",1

Person2: I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
Person1: There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Person2: We are fighting for a cause much ...
Person1: Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.

Person1: She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Person2: You got weird kids, Frank.
Person1: Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.",1
"Person1: Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Person2: Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Person1: Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.",1
"Person1: Do you like music?
Person2: Yes, I do -- very much.
Person1: Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Person2: Of course, my dear.
Person1: You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
Person2: You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
Person1: I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Person2: I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
Person1: I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Person2: I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Person1: Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Person2: Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Person1: Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Person2: Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Person1: Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Person2: Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.",0
"Person1: What you gonna do? Kill me?
Person2: Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Person1: Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?",1
"Person1: Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Person2: Something like that. Will you do it?
Person1: Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Person2: I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Person1: I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.",1
"Person1: I've been looking for you.
Person2: Why me? What do you want from me!?",0
"Person1: Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Person2: I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Person1: She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Person2: Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
Person1: You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Person2: I do. Goodbye.",0
"Person1: This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Person2: Are you still following me?
Person1: Please, Jill ... I love you.
Person2: Go away.
Person1: There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Person2: Leave me alone!
Person1: You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Person2: You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Person1: I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
Person2: I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Person1: ........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Person2: Oh ... Jesus!",1
"Person1: Got any booze in the house?
Person2: You don't drink ""booze"".
Person1: You do.
Person2: Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.",0
"Person1: What does this mean to you?
Person2: ...I had a dream about...something like that.
Person1: You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
Person2: You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
Person1: Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.",0
"Person1: I want out.
Person2: Too late...They want you.
Person1: Why? AL  You know too much.
Person1: I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Person2: You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?",1
"Person1: In so many words, yes.
Person2: Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Person1: It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.",1
"Person1: What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
Person2: I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Person1: I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my...
Person2: All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?",1
"Person1: Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Person2: Something awful happened last night.
Person1: What do you mean?!
Person2: I... I don't think you want to know.
Person1: Cecile, you have to tell me.
Person2: It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Person1: Does your mother know?
Person2: If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Person1: Why didn't you do something?
Person2: I don't know.
Person1: So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Person2: Well... not exactly.
Person1: He made you give him a blow job.
Person2: No.
Person1: Well what then?",1
"Person1: You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
Person2: You're right.",0
"Person1: I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
Person2: You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
Person1: I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Person2: I'm sure it is.
Person1: You'll think about my offer?
Person2: You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Person1: Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.",0
"Person1: THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
Person2: No.
Person1: THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Person2: No!",1
"Person1: I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Person2: Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Person1: I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Person2: Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Person1: Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Person2: I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Person1: Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Person2: I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid ""trial""! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Person1: That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Person2: Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!",1
"Person1: Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
Person2: Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!",0
"Person1: Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Person2: What do you want with us?
Person1: Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.",1
"Person1: If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
Person2: I'm not using him as an excuse.
Person1: Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
Person2: I do not.
Person1: I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
Person2: I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
Person1: They're not picking me up until six.
Person2: I'll think about it.
Person1: Yes!",1
"Person1: What's that you're playing?
Person2: Just a little something of my own.
Person1: Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Person2: No, I don't.

Person2: Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Person1: If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Person2: Yes, boss.",1
"Person1: Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Person2: I don't know.
Person1: Think.",0
"Person1: ...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
Person2: I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Person1: You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Person2: Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Person1: You're gross.  See that guy?
Person2: Which one?
Person1: He gives me a total boner!
Person2: He's like the biggest idiot of all time!",1
"Person1: You need to call your dad.
Person2: Leave us alone right now.
Person1: I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.",0
"Person1: I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
Person2: What?
Person1: It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
Person2: There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Person1: Do you think the police did a good job?
Person2: I don't know.  I think so.
Person1: It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Person2: No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Person1: If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.",0
"Person1: I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Person2: No...
Person1: My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.",0
"Person1: Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
Person2: Why do you have Dickie's rings?",1
"Person1: I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Person2: No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Person1: Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?",1
"Person1: Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!

Person1: Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and you with it, Mr. Governor!
Person2: Me! Jim--how--?
Person1: You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your high office to help him get it done. Understand?
Person2: Y-yes, Jim.
Person1: I doubt it! Come on, Ken.",1
"Person1: The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Person2: Yes.
Person1: All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.",1
"Person1: It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Person2: How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Person1: This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--here--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Person2: Hey!--you're tickling me.
Person1: Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?",0
"Person1: That's a lie!  They still want me!
Person2: No, they don't.
Person1: What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Person2: He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Person1: Wanted what?
Person2: De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Person1: That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Person2: You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.

Person2: I am answering...
Person1: What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.",1
"Person1: Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
Person2: Oh, cut the crap!
Person1: I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Person2: He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Person1: You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.",1
"Person1: What's you last name?
Person2: Childers.
Person1: What are all them books?
Person2: Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.

Person2: Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
Person1: Don't you live somewhere?
Person2: I did live there in the state hospital.
Person1: Why'd you live there?
Person2: I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Person1: They let you out?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: How come?

Person2: Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.

Person2: No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.

Person2: What's that?
Person1: That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.

Person1: Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.

Person2: Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Person1: Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Person2: Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Person1: I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Person2: How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Person1: Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip. You paid to be a secret agent.
Person2: Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Person1: What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?

I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...

Person1: As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.

Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Person2: Fine. But what would I do at night?
Person1: Be here. In case.
Person2: In case of what?
Person1: In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.",1
"Person1: No, of course not... I never killed anyone...

Person2: We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Person1: Yes, probably... maybe...
Person2: So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Person1: Yes, but...
Person2: Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
Person1: No, I... I held it up to...
Person2: You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?

Person1: Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.

"Person1: I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Person2: Understanding of what?
Person1: Like I might be in love with another woman.
Person2: In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Person1: Look who's talking. You've been there.
Person2: Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
Person1: This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Person2: And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Person1: Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Person2: You're crazy. You've gone crazy.

Person1: Mine?
Person2: Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
Person1: Mitchell was dead enough.
Person2: And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Person1: Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Person2: Magruder does.
Person1: You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Person2: But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Person1: Would I want to?

Person2: Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.

I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?

Person1: My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Person2: And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Person1: The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Person2: In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?

Person2: Can't say that I do.
Person1: Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.",0

Person2: Who the heck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Person1: What are you saying?
Person2: Hello?  Last birthday was?
Person1: I don't look my age, Joe.
Person2: Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Person1: It's a shit novel anyway.
Person2: Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Person1: Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Person2: Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean anything anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Person1: Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Person2: Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Person1: Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?",1
"Person1: Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Person2: Um, news flash. I dont give a shit.
Person1: Kat, stop it. You do. You cant even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.",1
"Person1: Who the hell do you think you are?!
Person2: Excuse me.
Person1: I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Person2: Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Person1: Is that so?",1
"Person1: When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
Person2: I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Person1: The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
Person2: Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Person1: You seem pretty sure of that.
Person2: Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.",0
"Person1: I heard from Lisa that you've been spreading rumors about my promotion being undeserved.
Person2: You are making that up. Why would I say something like that?
Person1: Lisa has no reason to lie. I trust her.
Person2: Maybe she misunderstood. It's not like you to jump to conclusions.
Person1: I just want transparency between us.
Person2: And I want you to trust me over baseless gossip.",1
"Person1: She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Person2: Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of ""captive"" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
Person1: The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Person2: I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
Person1: Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Person2: I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.",1
"Person1: You made your decision yet?
Person2: I'm leaning toward no.

"Person1: It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
Person2: There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
Person1: That's not the point.
Person2: You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--

Person1: You- Do you love me?
Person2: Do I love you?
Person1: That's the key question.
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: I know you've only known me a short while.
Person2: Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Person1: I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Person2: Yeah.

Person2: I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?",1

Person2: I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.

Person2: ...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't mess with this case.

"Person1: Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Person2: Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Person1: I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Person2: Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Person1: Sir, let those laugh that win.
Person2: I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?",0
"Person1: Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Person2: Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.",1

Person1: Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Person2: Oh, good.
Person1: He won't do anything for me, but for you --

Person1: The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Person2: Darn it. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.

We are the last of our kind, Macleod.

Person2: Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself",0
"Person1: If you did know, you'd tell me.
Person2: Of course --
Person1: If you trusted me, you'd know.
Person2: We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?",1
"Person1: The arrangement is over!
Person2: No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Person1: And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Person2: I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you bitch!",1
"Person1: What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Person2: Vecchio.
Person1: Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
Person2: Bits and pieces.
Person1: She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Person2: And what about your own hand?
Person1: No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Person1: It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Person2: Oh, yeah?
Person1: Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
Person2: And how do you bluff yourself?
Person1: Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
Person2: Except this time, the mission IS a man.
Person1: That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
Person2: John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Person1: I think you're right, Keith.
Person2: You want me to take over?",1
"Person1: What the hell is that for?
Person2: The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Person1: I don't --  Do that stuff.
Person2: Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Person1: Projecting joy is not my job.
Person2: Fine. Sorry I brought it up.",1
"Person1: I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Person2: No.
Person1: It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Person2: I don't think so.
Person1: Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!",1
"Person1: Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
Person2: I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
Person1: What? Everybody knows God is White.
Person2: But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
Person1: What for?
Person2: Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
Person1: What the hell for, man?
Person2: Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Person1: Okay, okay. Show me, man.",1
"Person1: But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Person2: Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Person1: We don't have time to argue about it!
Person2: Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Person1: Take the rope.
Person2: I won't do it.  No way.
Person1: Take the rope.
Person2: Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Person1: Wrap it around that rock twice.
Person2: I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Person1: An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Person2: Forget it!  I refuse!
Person1: Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.

"Person1: And never take.
Person2: Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Person1: Forget it.
Person2: You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Person1: I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
Person2: We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
Person1: That's why you're a gambling man.
Person2: That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
Person1: For the third time.
Person2: Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.",1

Person1: I can't.
Person2: You've got to get your mind off this.
Person1: You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Person2: Go!
Person1: And don't ever try to see me again.
Person2: What are you talking about?
Person1: Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Person2: Do you think I care
Person1: You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Person2: I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Person1: I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Person2: Dorothy!
Person1: How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.

Person1: No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own army, pal!

Person1: You want me to get out of my own town?!
Person2: Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.

Person1: Your ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Person2: Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't mess around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Person1: You're makin' a big spectacle of yourself.
Person2: Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Person1: Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your license on me, is that it?
Person2: No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...

When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.

My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...

Person1: This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.",1
"Person1: What are you going to do?
Person2: I loved you, Madeleine.
Person1: I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!",1

Person2: I don't care.

"Person1: Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
Person2: But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Person1: We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
Person2: But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
Person1: C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
Person2: I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Person1: I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Person2: Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Person1: That's the spirit.
Person2: Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Person1: We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Person2: Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Person1: No, Mrs. Lampert.
Person2: But no one actually saw him die.
Person1: No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Person2: Oh. Then who's this one?
Person1: I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Person2: Me? Why me?
Person1: You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Person2: Agents.",1
"Person1: Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
Person2: What are you talking about?
Person1: Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
Person2: A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!",1

"Person1: I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Person2: What?
Person1: This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Person2: You don't trust me?
Person1: I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.",1

"Person1: It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
Person2: Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.",1
"Person1: Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
Person2: Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Person1: You fell in love with her first.
Person2: Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Person1: You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Person2: That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Person1: Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
Person2: Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
Person1: I need a shower.
Person2: I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, ""he's some kind of monster.""

"Person1: An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
Person2: It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Person1: When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Person2: You're still a writer.
Person1: I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Person2: Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Person1: Marcia, please.
Person2: No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Person1: Marcia, you know I started ""Misery"" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Person2: I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, ""Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted. An esoteric, semi-autobiographical character study.
Person1: Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.",1
"Person1: I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
Person2: She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
Person1: She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?",1

Person2: No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.

Person1: Would you stop with that...
Person2: Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Person1: The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Person2: Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Person1: Because I don't walk away.
Person2: Why not?
Person1: It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Person2: Closest and oldest.
Person1: And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
Person2: And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?

Person1: All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?

Person2: Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Person1: You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Person2: He did?
Person1: Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, ""You know, you are beautiful."" Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Person2: Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Person1: He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Person2: Yeah, I'd believe it.
Person1: Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Person2: Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Person1: I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.",1

Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.

We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a ""B"".

I've encouraged you to get out of this lousy dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that woman dumped you, oh so many years ago.

Person2: Miles. Miles. Miles.
Person1: I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.

Person1: I don't.
Person2: For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Person1: What you heard wasn't sex.
Person2: What the heck was it?
Person1: All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.

Person2: It isn't always this rough?
Person1: Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
Person2: They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Person1: Our minds?
Person2: For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
Person1: You're an attractive man.
Person2: You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Person1: But I'm married.
Person2: Something else we have in common.
Person1: Very happily married.
Person2: Same here.
Person1: And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
Person2: It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
Person1: I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Person2: Ayuh.
Person1: You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Person2: Of course not.
Person1: It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Person2: Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Person1: But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.",1
"Person1: Well?
Person2: Ahh, she will be yours.
Person1: When!?
Person2: At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
Person1: The moon is almost gone!
Person2: Ahh, there is yet time.
Person1: At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
Person2: I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Person1: I would have time for my own pleasures!
Person2: Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. No one is to challenge that authority, no one!.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Person1: I understand, Master

"Person1: They found another note?
Person2: Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Person1: You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Person2: This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Person1: Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Person2: Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Person1: Why would the police come to you?
Person2: Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
Person1: What about me?
Person2: You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
Person1: So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
Person2: It was '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Person1: What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Person2: It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Person1: You used to say that was our strength.
Person2: Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Person1: Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Person2: All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Person1: Off the record.
Person2: Always.
Person1: Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
Person2: And?
Person1: The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Person2: Someone stole Sid's file?
Person1: I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Person2: I'm sorry, this is too good!
Person1: What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Person2: Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it?
Person1: I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.

Person1: Hey, I'm learning as I go.

Person2: I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.",1
"Person1: I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.

"Person1: I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?

Person2: One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Person1: Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Person2: Call me whatever you want.
Person1: Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Person2: I frisk you?
Person1: You frisk me.
Person2: Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
Person1: I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
Person2: Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Person1: How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Person2: They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Person1: Okay, give us the women.
Person2: Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Person1: You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...

Person2: Yeah?
Person1: I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone.

Person2: The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Person1: You don't think there's much time left, do you?
Person2: That's not what I said.
Person1: You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Person2: No.
Person1: Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? ""Begin to prepare for the inevitable.""
Person2: Maybe you should think about it.
Person1: What's that mean?!
Person2: Maybe you should think about it.
Person1: I'm not going to die.
Person2: That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Person1: You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into victims?
Person2: Then, what are we, Drew?! The winners? ""Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..."" Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. Darn it!

Person2: About raping me?
Person1: About NOT raping you...
Person2: You DON'T like it, do you?
Person1: Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Person2: What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Person1: Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Person2: Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
Person1: To pay for the next expedition, of course.
Person2: But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Person1: Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Person2: Well you started it.
Person1: I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Person2: And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.",1
"Person1: What's that?
Person2: Ten bucks.
Person1: What's it for?
Person2: For the mini-bike fund.
Person1: Wow!

"Person1: Murdered?  Why?
Person2: There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
Person1: What kinda twisted animal.
Person2: Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Person1: Whatta you mean...
Person2: He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
Person1: What are you talking about?
Person2: Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
Person1: I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
Person2: I don't know...  What about the other women?
Person1: I'll warn them.
Person2: That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
Person1: What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
Person2: No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Person1: So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Person2: They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
Person1: I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Person2: I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.",1

Person1: Your life.
Person2: How?",1

Person2: Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
Person1: What gave you that idea?
Person2: In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Person1: Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Person2: I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Person1: I forgive you.
Person2: You shouldn't.
Person1: You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Person2: Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Person1: Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Person2: Cheers.",0

Person2: We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Person1: No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Person2: Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Person1: Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Person2: I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Person1: No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Person2: Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Person1: That's what I'm counting on.
Person2: But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.

Person2: What was your name again?
Person1: Erica.
Person2: Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Person1: Deep down. Way down.
Person2: It's a mistake to think that.
Person1: We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Person2: It's nice to do a lot of things.
Person1: That's what I mean.
Person2: I'm not a nice guy.
Person1: I know. It's okay.
Person2: Yeah?
Person1: Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.

Person2: You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?

Person2: Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.",1

I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Person1: Put your head back.

The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one.

I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Person2: Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Person1: What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Person2: Courtyard?
Person1: Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Person2: Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
Person1: John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?

Person2: Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Person1: It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Person2: And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.

Person1: Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.

He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions.

Person2: Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Person1: Maybe I dont.

Person2: Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.

Person2: Your doctor?
Person1: Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Person2: ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Person1: It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Person2: You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

Person2: Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Person1: Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Person2: And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Person1: We're in negotiations, that's correct.

Person1: I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Person2: Why don't you tell me about ""Miss Mofet?"" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Person1: His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under ""Missing Person"" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Person2: If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Person1: Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Person2: Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?

Person1: Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but do you think he envisions... scenarios, interactions... being intimate with you?
Person2: That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Person1: Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
Person2: I don't know. Is it?
Person1: Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.",1

And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Person2: Beg pardon?
Person1: Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Person2: But now you can't go.
Person1: Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Person2: Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Person1: Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.",1
"Person1: This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
Person2: If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Person1: Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?",1
"Person1: How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Person2: You didn't say anything about my hair.",1
"Person1: Hello?
Person2: Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!",0
"Person1: Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Person2: No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
Person1: How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Person2: I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Person1: It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Person2: I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Person1: Gosh. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Person2: I almost got married once.
Person1: Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Person2: Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
Person1: Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Person2: She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Person1: Lovely.
Person2: She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Person1: You don't take anything seriously, do you?
Person2: I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Person1: I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. They are going to kill me one day.
Person2: Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Person1: They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Person2: Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Person1: Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
Person2: It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
Person1: No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Person2: It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Person1: Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Person2: They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Person1: I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Person2: Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.",1
"Person1: Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
Person2: Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
Person1: You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?",0
"Person1: I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Person2: You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a bit odd it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a timid person.",1
"Person1: Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
Person2: Goodness, Joe. Forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.",1
"Person1: Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Person2: Oh, I'm very grateful.",0
"Person1: I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
Person2: No.
Person1: I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.",1
"Person1: What are you crazy?
Person2: Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you understand? I want you to get off your backside. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Person1: I can't... they don't work that way...
Person2: Forget how they work. Just do it. Like your man says, ""By any means necessary.""",1
"Person1: Santos... What's happenin' here?
Person2: Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Person1: Where we goin'?
Person2: Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Person1: Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?",1
"Person1: Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
Person2: Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
Person1: It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
Person2: How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Person1: You're right, Joe.
Person2: Of course I am.
Person1: First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
Person2: No we're not.
Person1: We're not?
Person2: First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Person1: You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Person2: He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Person1: What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Person2: Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Person1: But suppose he loses?
Person2: What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Person1: But suppose it doesn't?
Person2: Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?",1
"Person1: Who do you think you are? Where do you think you are? Why do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
Person2: I have money --
Person1: I got money.
Person2: I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
Person1: I want your money, I'll take your money.
Person2: Just tell me where she is.",1
"Person1: He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Person2: Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Person1: Can't you tell me now?
Person2: I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name ""Zuul"" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Person1: You must have gotten the last copy.
Person2: Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
Person1: Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  ""Zuul was the Minion of Gozer.""
Person2: ""Gozer"" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
Person1: What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Person2: I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
Person1: I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
Person2: You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Person1: All right.  Since you put it that way.
Person2: I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Person1: I've got to go now.",0
"Person1: Baby, please don't... I love you.
Person2: I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Person1: Baby, don't do this --

Person1: -- please, baby --
Person2: -- no, it'll help me, really --
Person1: How?

"Person1: What happened?
Person2: You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
Person1: So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd rather use a donor egg--  --if it came to it.
Person2: But ""if it came to it"" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
Person1: You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--what you are?  Don't you get any satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
Person2: That's precisely what scares me--that they won't do anything foolish or courageous or anything--worth a Goddamn.",1
"Person1: Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
Person2: Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Person1: That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --

"Person1: Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Person2: Oh, hiya, Pete.
Person1: So, no goat hooves, huh?
Person2: I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Person1: Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Person2: Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.",0
"Person1: Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
Person2: There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Person1: What do I get out of it?
Person2: If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Person1: You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer",1

Person2: He's got piano lessons.
Person1: Oh yeah? How's he doing?

Person2: -- You remember.
Person1: Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Person2: The great communicator.

Person2: Okay.
Person1: I treated you better.
Person2: You treated me like shit.",1

Person2: Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.",0
"Person1: I'm thinking of moving on, Alex. This relationship doesn't feel right anymore.
Person2: After everything we've been through? You won't find anyone else who treats you like I do.
Person1: Maybe that's the problem. I need space and independence. It feels like you're trying to control everything.
Person2: I just want the best for you, for us.

"Person1: Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Person2: I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
Person1: One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Person2: Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Person1: I dont.
Person2: Good.
Person1: Is there anything to understand?
Person2: Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Person1: Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Person2: You bastard...
Person1: Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Person2: You splendid bastard...
Person1: Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Person2: ...Were turning in circles.
Person1: And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Person2: Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Person1: A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
Person2: I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Person1: What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Person2: Something like that.
Person1: Something like that?
Person2: Something like that.
Person1: What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Person2: Here we go again.
Person1: Where is that?
Person2: Simplify and damn.
Person1: Dont you believe in simplicity?
Person2: Should I?
Person1: We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
Person2: You seem to know what youre talking about.
Person1: Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
Person2: My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Person1: To get me killed...?
Person2: I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Person1: Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Person2: Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...",1
